This notebook provides a hands-on introduction to the **YOLOv8** object detection model using the **Ultralytics** library. It's designed to help you get started quickly with real-time object detection and understand how YOLO works under the hood.

### ✅ What You’ll Learn:

- ✅ How to **install** and use the Ultralytics YOLO library
- ✅ How to **load** pretrained YOLO models of different sizes (`nano`, `small`, etc.)
- ✅ How to **perform inference** in **real-time** using OpenCV
- ✅ How to **draw bounding boxes** and display class names
- ✅ How to **manipulate and access predictions** (labels, confidences, coordinates)
- ✅ How to work with **YOLO class labels** and understand detection outputs

> This notebook serves as a foundation before diving into more advanced YOLO use-cases such as training, fine-tuning, or deployment.
